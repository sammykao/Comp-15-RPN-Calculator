Program Purpose:
The purpose of this program is to build a RPN Calculator.
An RPN Calculator utilizes a stack, and ultimately computes
with the operators to the right of two numbers. So, this program
builds a calculator that can not only do operations, but also
use comparison operators (<, >, >=, etc), and can calculate 
using seperate brackets that act as parentheses or hold files
no be executed upon

C. Acknowledgements: 
     No help was received and ideas/implementation were all organic

D. Files: 

parser.h: This file holds the declaration of the parseRstring function
that takes an input stream (After we discover there will be an rstring) 
and returns an rstring

parser.cpp: This file holds the definition of the parseRstring function
that parses an rstring from an input stream and returns it in order for us
to add it to our stack
   
Datum.h: This file holds the interface of our Datum class. The datum 
objects are objects of three types: Integer, boolean, rstring. Datum 
object class has specific functions that we can perform on them
such as comparisons of data types, retrival, and return a string of 
the datum value

DatumStack.h: This file holds the interface of our DatumStack Class. 
The DatumStack Objects act as our stack for our RPNCalculators. It 
obviously holds Datum objects, and has multiple member functions that 
are with it. 

DatumStack.cpp: This file holds the implementation of our DatumStack Class. 
The DatumStack Object acts as our stack for our RPNCalculators. The 
member functions that come with our DatumStack class include, retrieval,
acess, and printing functions.

RPNCalc.h: This file is the interface of the RPNCalc class. The
RPNCalc class is basically our polished calculator program 
with command functions implemented for the user. It runs off one 
public run function until the user quits.

RPNCalc.cpp: This file is the implementation of the RPNCalc class. The 
main function is a public run function which calls on a private query 
loop and other private command functions so other clients do not have 
acess to anything except running the calculator

main.cpp: This file is the main file of our project. It acts as 
basically the user client calling upon the calculator. 

unit_tests.h: This file is for testing our preliminary stage classes. 
So, unit_test.h and the unit test driver was used to test the DatumStack
class and also the parser.h function(s). The other classes were either
pre-implemented (Datum.h) or tested using reference implementation 
diff testing with testing input/files.

README: This file is the description of our project program, as
well as all files included, purpose, data structures, and an in-depth
explanation of any explainable parts.


E. Compile: To compile and run the program users can 
use - Make (This will compile all our files together 
to make our complete program)
To compile and run testing part, users can use - Unit_test
(Unit_test_driver.o and unit_test)

F: Data Structures: The main data structure of our
project was a stack. It was implemented in our DatumStack 
class, and was built using imported vector class. The 
structure was implemented by abstraction with the vector class
so only stack type methods could be performed by the user (I.e. 
adding to top and retrieving the top only). Stacks are optimally
used in instances where tasks or data are performed or stored 
sequentially but the newer ones are to be adressed firt
in the LIFO method. This can be seen in systemic memory management 
(Like in C++!), or even like with recursion 
(Must do one task before moving on). A great full end algorithm example 
of this idea of stacks is with the one of the metric first search 
algorithm used in binary trees. A stack holds node values in the tree
and as the tree is explored farther branch by branch, he two new paths 
of descention down a path is put in the stack, continually adding paths
to the stack until either no more to put on or take off and value is
met or not met. On a micro level, algorithms for each of the stack
functions like pop() are implemented. For pop, it starts by seeing
if the stack is empty and returning if true, else it will remove 
top value and de-increment stack size. Then it will return. Generally,
the algorithms in stack structures are simpler, with only one or two
conditionals as well as a command.



G: Testing:
The testing for the DatumStack class
ranged from simple functionality, to more complex with multiple commands,
to even error testing with runtime errors. parseRstring was also tested
using the unit test driver with both a correctly syntaxed file and also
an incorrectly syntaxed stringstream. It will throw an error message if 
incorrectly syntaxed. For the RPNCalc class, testing was used with
the reference implementation and diff testing. Not only were tests
conducted using giving cyl -> cylc files, but also with files that
were made specifically for testing.
